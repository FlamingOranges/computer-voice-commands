this is just voice commands i made for myself to make things easier. prolly wont work on your computer ngl

# installation

use pip to get ``speechrecognition`` and ``pyaudio``

no executable file yet, just run main and have a mic hooked up. it starts listening from there

create a folder called "shortcuts" within the main folder. 

i dont know why youd install this. maybe ill make a version one day that lets you make your own shortcuts and commands
