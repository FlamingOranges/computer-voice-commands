this is just voice commands i made for myself to make things easier. prolly wont work on your computer ngl

# installation

use pip to get ``speechrecognition`` and ``pyaudio``

no executable file yet, just run main and have a mic hooked up. it starts listening from there


# commands

**computer open jackass**: opens twitch/tv/coney

**computer open vinny**: opens twitch.tv/vinesauce

**stop listening**: kills the process
