this is just voice commands i made for myself to make things easier. prolly wont work on your computer ngl

# installation

use pip to get ``speechrecognition`` and ``pyaudio``

no executable file yet, just run main and have a mic hooked up. it starts listening from there

create a folder called "shortcuts" within the main folder. 


# commands
### place shortcut files in here yourself nerd. name them appropriately

**computer open jackass**: opens twitch.tv/coney

shortcut name: trimmer.lnk

**computer let's go gambling**: opens buckshot roulette
